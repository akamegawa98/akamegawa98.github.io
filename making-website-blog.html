			<div id="title-text"><i>This is actually the second redesign of my personal website. Before this sleek and stylish iteration, this website was a gradient covered mess filled with lame attempts at adding Javascript capabilities. Most of what I know is from taking the <a id="link" href=”https://www.wdd.io/”>student-run web design course </a> at UC Berkeley. There, I learned a lot about how to go from a bare-bones HTML page to a fully animated powerhouse of a website. </i></div>
			<div id="project-point-right">
				<p>I’m glad I took the course because it taught me a great deal about how we create and interact with the internet. Although the course didn’t go into the backend infrastructure that makes sites like YouTube and Facebook work, it covered a great deal about what it takes to produce good user interfaces and experiences. </p>
			</div>
			<div id="project-point-right">
				<p>It’s been about 6 months since I completed the course, but I decided to take on the project of redesigning my personal website to give me a refresher on making web pages from scratch (in a reasonable amount of time). It’s taken me about a month to get this site to a reasonably presentable state, so I thought I’d share some things I learned. </p>
			</div>
			<div id="project-point-right">
				<p><font size="+7">1.</font> Taking a course in basic HTML, CSS, and jQuery was crucial to my understanding of the website creation pipeline. I realized, 6 months after finishing the course, that I had forgotten a lot of little things, but these gaps were easily filled because I knew <i>where</i> to look. A great place to start, if you’re looking to build a kind of top down understanding of designing online interfaces is <a id="link" href=”https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/html-css”>this</a> or <a id="link" href=”https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99vHH_6F0Ko”>this</a> website/channel. I would also recommend <a id="link" href=”https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp”>here</a> and <a id="link" href=”https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/”> here</a> if you’re like me and there are a lot of gaps in your knowledge. </p>

			<div id="project-point-right">
				<p><font size="+7">2.</font> The web inspector (viewable through Ctrl+shift+C if you’re using your Chrome), I can’t emphasize this enough, is just great. There’s a lot of little hidden stylings that go behind certain HTML tags which aren’t super intuitive, but you can figure out what they are fairly easily using the box model in the inspector.</p>
			</div>
			<div id="project-point-right">
				<p><font size="+7">3.</font>Templates were my best friend through this process. I made 4 basic html templates that each had their own css styling. I made one for my hello page, one that I used to explain the details of my projects/jobs, one for my menu pages (the pages linked to project., blog., and work.), and one for a splash page (which never came to fruition). Because I had these templates, I was able to fly through putting up the meat of my website (like what you’re reading now :-).</p>
			</div>
			<div id="project-point-right">
				<p><font size="+7">4.</font> Having a fully fleshed out wireframe was also super awesome! It allowed me to be able to prototype the aesthetics of this page really quickly. No matter how good I see myself getting at HTML and CSS, nothing is faster than dragging colored squares and lorem ipsum chunks onto an artboard.</p>
			</div>
			<div id="project-point-right">
			<p>Keep in mind that I’m still a beginner at making websites! These are just a few things I learned and I hope they help if you decide to make your own website.</p>
