				<div id="subhead"><b>Introduction</b></div>
				<div id="content">My project partner, Ray Bacco, and I designed and fabricated a highly maneuverable, 3D-printed, bluetooth controlled robot that moved left and right, up and down, and side to side. With the help of our instructor, we developed a series of sketches to plan out the body and functionality of the car. We knew that we wanted it to have a lot of mobility – our goal was for each of the car’s units to be able to move up and down, left to right, and side to side. We also designed for the car to look playful by giving it curved edges and big wheels. I worked on refining the sketches to get a better idea of the project's path. </div>

				<div id="subhead"><b>Prototyping</b></div>
				<div id="content">We made several functional prototypes in cardboard and plywood to experiment with our car’s movement. We used a 3D-printed spinner toy, designed by Walter Hsiao, as the central joint for our car because it gave us two different degrees of motion. By playing with these prototypes, we were able to rapidly refine the form and function of our product. I helped to assemble and test these various prototypes.</div>

				<div id="subhead"><b>CAD Work</b></div>
				<div id="content">I modeled bearings, a three-unit body, custom wheels, and end caps in Fusion 360. The pieces were specially designed to fit the batteries, motors, spinner toy joint and bluetooth-enabled microcontroller that needed to fit in and around the car. The modeled pieces were then printed on Ultimaker 3D printers in PLA. My project partner and I then assembled the pieces together. </div>

				<div id="subhead"><b>Assembly & Refinement</b></div>
				<div id="content">After printing out the pieces, we then had to develop a motor chassis for our car. We used the laser cutter to make a rig for the motors and battery packs. Additionally, we spent some time refining our mechanical components. We added a plate to the back of our spinner toy to create resistance. We also worked on perfecting the functionality of our. In the end, the design includes a 3 part chassis with 4 gearbox motors powered by 2 5-volt battery packs. The inner unit has two free floating wheels and contains the electronic components. The two outer pieces hold extra battery packs and the gearbox motors. The car is approximately 1.5 feet long and eight inches wide.  </div>

				<div id="subhead"><b>Future Directions</b></div>
				<div id="content">I’d like to see this project open sourced. All of the electronic parts are available in your average makerspace and the body is made entirely of 3D CAD models, so it’s quite conducive to reproduction by hobbyists. </div>
