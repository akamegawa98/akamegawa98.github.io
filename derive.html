			<div id="title-text"><i>Derive was a project with Nick Doershlag, Janaki Vivrekar, Meena Kaushik, and Tonya Nguyen for <a id="link" href="make.berkeley.edu/">
 Critical Making</a>. We were motivated to create Derive to encourage people to focus less on getting from point A to point B, and more on appreciating the journey between the two. Instead of navigating the user to specific locations or paths, Derive encourages users to explore their surroundings by subtly suggesting users in certain directions that align with their personal preferences.</i></div>

				<p> Derive is a shoe connected through bluetooth to an app. We decided to use the Android mobile platform to create our mobile app, with the goal of making our technology as accessible as possible. We also designed our system with the intention of making the application open-source, and built it in a way that would support the possibility of creating an accessible API for users to develop and adapt the app for their own use cases.</p>
			</div>
			<div id="project-point-right">
				<p> In order to create the physical shoe model, we initially iterated in paper and cardboard. This allowed us to make quick changes and incorporate different mockup of electronic designs. We learned a large amount of information through this process such as the appropriate placement of electronics to mitigate mechanical damages to the product through everyday use. </p>

				<p> Our code to program the Adafruit Feather to control the Neopixels is a modified version of a tutorial from <a id="link" href="https://learn.adafruit.com/ble-feather-lamp"> Adafruit</a> that allows users to use the Bluefruit app to control the color patterns of a neopixel lamp. We programmed our Feather to create four different signals, indicating the following to the user: turn left, turn right, move forward, and you have arrived.</p>

				<p>  We programmed the neopixel strip to accept certain bluetooth packages that signaled for certain light patterns. Because a feather M0 takes 3.3 V and a Neopixel strip takes 5 V, we initially fitted our electronics with a logic level shifter to protect the feather while providing adequate power to the Neopixels.</p>
			</div>
			<div id="project-point-right">
				<p> We designed our final electronic suit to fit snugly into the sole of a shoe. While the product could ultimately be fit into a fully custom designed shoe, we decided to use a logoless shoe. </p>
			</div>
			<div id="project-point-right">
				<p> By using a real shoe in our final product, it gave us the rigidity and flexibility that could only be created with the materials used in shoe construction. We then applied a layer of customization to the shoe that created our final design. </p>

			<div id="project-point-right">
				<p> I always think of this project as one of the stronger concepts I’ve worked on. I love the rainbow signals from the Neopixel strips and the opportunity to work with people that were so strong in app development, both front and back end. In the future, I would like to work on developing the actual navigating by integrating it with Google’s directions API.</p>
