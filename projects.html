					<p> Virtual Tomb was a project done with Sarah Tsung, Natalea Shager, Hyein Kim, Kirsten Chen, Florence Lee and Silvia Kim, in collaboration with Justin Underhill and Assistant Professor Rita Lucarelli, to exhibit 3D models of tombs produced by the Phoebe A. Hearst Museum in a virtual reality space. We used Unity, Playmaker, Sketch Up and Unity Assets to create this virtual environment.</p>

					<p> Bibo is a compression therapy armband, developed as a final project for Critical Making with Janaki Vivrekar, James Smith, and Melissa Su. With context-aware modes of sensing an athleteâ€™s heartbeat, BiBO equips the wearer with an automated regulator for real-time muscle recovery. Upon detecting a relaxed pulse, BiBO automatically activates a gradual compression on the athlete's arm, to help modulate blood circulation and reduce inflammation.</p>

					<a id="project-header" href="derive.html">Derive.</a>
					<p> Derive was a project developed with Nick Doershlag, Janaki Vivrekar, Meena Kaushik, and Tonya Nguyen for Critical Making. We were motivated to create Derive to encourage people to focus less on getting from point A to point B, and more on appreciating the journey between the two. Instead of navigating the user to specific locations or paths, Derive encourages users to explore their surroundings by subtly suggesting users in certain directions that align with their personal preferences.</p>

					<a id="project-header" href="free_library.html">Free Library.</a>
					<p> This mobile library was created with Angela Huang, Debbie Yuen, Andrew Louie, and Jeremy Rosen as an act of solidarity with UC-AFT, a union representing librarians and non-Senate faculty serving the University of California. The librarians of the UC system are bargaining with the University of California to get the wages and rights they need to provide UC campuses with invaluable resources. The goal of this project is to create a mobile artifact that shows more people the reach and value of UC librarians. </p>
