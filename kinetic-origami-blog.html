			<div id="title-text"><i>This project was my first venture into prototyping and fabrication! It was taught by the wonderful <a id="link" href=”https://citris-uc.org/person/chris-myers/”>Chris Myers</a>, a lecturer at UC Berkeley and senior lab manager at the Invention Lab. I got a lot of advice from him throughout the process of making this little art piece. This goal of this project was to make a piece of origami move with a servo motor. For my piece, I used a servo and a series of tracks to move a piece of cardstock that I had folded into a herringbone pattern. </i></div>

				<p> Initially, I ran into road bumps because the string kept digging into the cardboard base. This issue was solved by placing dowels near the openings in the lid where the string would emerge.</p>

				<p>Additionally, I wanted my origami to have a nice curvature to it as it move, so I constructed a tube out of corrugated cardboard that I could place under my piece in order to get it to bend.</p>

				<p> In conclusion, I feel like this piece came out really elegantly. The focus remains on the stark whiteness of the origami and the black and cardboard elements that surround it give it a nice frame. In future iterations, I’d like to construct the base out of more robust material like acrylic. It would be interesting to use transparent acrylic so viewers could see the inner workings of the piece.</p>
