			<div id="title-text"><i>Our drawing machine was two disks connected to two DC motors whose RPMs were determined by the two potentiometers on either side of the box. Those disks had hinged arms that eventually connect at a pen. The movement of the pen creates the final image on a piece of 8 ½ x 11 sheet of paper. I worked on this project with my classmate, Benjamin Liu.</i></div>

				<p> We first began by doing two cardboard mockups of the drawing machine. The first one was a very rough proof of concept. It was a flat piece of cardboard with two disks that had a few arms tacked together. The next cardboard mockup had a bigger box that was a guess of how deep it would need to be to hold two DC motors, the Arduino and the circuit. This model also had a more refined version of the knobs that we’d have to make in our final product to connect all the limbs.</p>

			<div id="project-point-right">
				<p> With the inception of our wood model came the putting together of our circuit. Benjamin got a great start on putting together the DC motor and potentiometer circuit. Also, Adam, our graduate student instructor, helped us develop the code that would help us route the analog signal of the potentiometers through the Arduino and to our motors. But when we revisited the set up later, the wires had loosened and things had fallen out of our bread board. </p>

				<p> One of the problems with the motors was the fact that our potentiometers weren’t sending a reliable signal to our Arduino. The next day, after redoing the wiring and combining wires with zip ties, Mitchell, a lab manager, also helped us out by pointing out, yet again, that we would need new potentiometers.</p>

				<p> The day before we turned in the project, we went out to test out the final product and realized that one of the motors wasn’t responding to its potentiometer. We had to go in and re-solder a few wires because they had snapped in the potentiometer holes. Nevertheless, the day of the project presentations, our drawing machine worked.</p>
			</div>
			<div id="project-point-right">
				<p> Overall, we considered the project to be a success. Of course, there is always more room for refinement and design. In the future, we’d like to experiment with using a microphone to control the RPMs of the DC motors. Additionally, we could work on the functionality of the pen holder. But overall, the drawing machine repeatedly created interesting final images and given the time we had to work, this was a great achievement.</p>
