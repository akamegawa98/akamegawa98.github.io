			<div id="title-text"><i>Lab Rat was a short, one minute film developed with Roshan Krishnan, Ben Liang, and Tom Lim for <a id="link" href="www.ucbugg.com/"> UCBUGG</a>, a student taught class that teaches modeling and animation in Maya and Adobe After Effects. </i></div>

				<p> We began by developing and pitching storyboards to the class. We then decided to develop my storyboard for Lab Rat, a film about a rat that sees the dark, bizarre underbelly of clinical research. After developing our storyboard, we produced an animatic that paced our film and set music to it. </p>

			<div id="project-point-right">
				<p> We then began to model our assets. I worked primarily on the main rat character. I modeled his body in Maya and created a skin for him in Adobe Illustrator. In addition to the main rat character, I also modelled and developed a skin for a monstera leaf prop. </p>

				<img id="proj-img" src="assets/img/rat-skeleton.PNG" alt="moon mobile" height="300">
				<p> I then rigged the rat character, giving it movement at major joints, eyes that were able to shift and fixate on things and a functioning skeleton. After the rigging was complete, we moved on to animation.</p>
			</div>
			<div id="project-point-right">
				<p> I was primarily involved in developing the walk cycle for the rat and moving it through the maze in the first few seconds of the film. In the future, I’d like to develop more dexterity in the rat’s toes while also refining the movement of his body in connection to his legs. </p>

			<div id="project-point-right">
				<p> This short was me and group's first dive into using Maya. I thought it was especially fun because I got to use some of the modelling skills I usually use in Fusion 360 in this more story based paradigm. Additionally, it was a lot of fun to see how our narrative took shape in our models, music choice, editing, and animating. </p>
