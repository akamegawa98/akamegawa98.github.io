					<p> This is actually the second redesign of my personal website. Before this sleek and stylish iteration, this website was a gradient covered mess filled with lame attempts at adding Javascript capabilities. Most of what I know is from taking the student-run web design course at UC Berkeley. There, I learned a lot about how to go from a bare-bones HTML page to a fully animated powerhouse of a website.</p>

					<p> So there’s this friend of mine named Hailey Hunter Windsor – she’s an incredible designer and an even better person (that’s really saying something because she totally kicks ass whenever she touches a power tool). We met because we took the same design course in the fall of 2018. We ended up spending a lot of time in the Invention Lab and eventually, we decided it would make sense for both of us to just move in and become Super Users.</p>

					<p> This project was my first venture into prototyping and fabrication! It was taught by the wonderful Chris Myers, a lecturer at UC Berkeley and senior lab manager at the Invention Lab. I got a lot of advice from him throughout the process of making this little art piece. This goal of this project was to make a piece of origami move with a servo motor. For my piece, I used a servo and a series of tracks to move a piece of cardstock that I had folded into a herringbone pattern.</p>

					<p> In Design Innovation 22, my project partner, Ray Bacco, and I designed and fabricated a highly maneuverable 3 3D-printed, bluetooth controlled robot that moved left and right, up and down, and side to side. The design includes a 3 part chassis with 4 gearbox motors powered by 2 5-volt battery packs.The inner unit has two free floating wheels and contains the electronic components. The two outer pieces hold extra battery packs and the gearbox motors.</p>

					<a id="project-header" href="drawing.html">Drawing Machine.</a>
					<p> Our drawing machine was two disks connected to two DC motors whose RPMs were determined by the two potentiometers on either side of the box. Those disks had hinged arms that eventually connect at a pen. The movement of the pen creates the final image on a piece of 8 ½ x 11 sheet of paper. I worked on this project with my classmate, Benjamin Liu.</p>

					<p> Nostrum Pills is a satirical company that my team and I developed for a final project in Design Innovation 190: Critical Practices. By developing a wellness pod, creative branding, an online platform, and a social media presence, we critiqued the wellness supplement culture that has become so prevalent in the modern day. This work was done with Heidi Dong, Hailey Windsor, Francesca Spektor, and Justine Chia.</p>
