			<div id="title-text"><i>This mobile library was created with Angela Huang, Debbie Yuen, Andrew Louie, and Jeremy Rosen as an act of solidarity with <a id="link" href="https://ucaft.org/"> UC-AFT</a>, a union representing librarians and non-Senate faculty serving the University of California. The librarians of the UC system are bargaining with the University of California to get the wages and rights they need to provide UC campuses with invaluable resources. The goal of this project is to create a mobile artifact that shows more people the reach and value of UC librarians. </i></div>

				<img id="proj-img" src="assets/img/lib-protest.jpg" alt="moon mobile" height="300">
				<p> We began by conducting 4 interviews with UC Berkeley librarians involved with the UC-AFT movement. We asked them questions about their position at Berkeley, role in the union, goals for the protest, views on academic freedom, common protest objects at the librarian protests, and their values as a librarian community. We found that their core motivations as a union was including Academic Freedom in their contracts,  ensuring higher salaries, and a greater focus on professional development.</p>

			<div id="project-point-right">
				<p> Our final concept was an open library box, that would play white noise to create a peaceful reading environment when activated by special pins. The pins would be worn by librarians, who can make the box start playing white noise by placing their pin on top and activating a sensor. </p>

				<p>The box would have a main section for books and papers that librarians were restricted from buying or publishing, symbolizing academic freedom, and also a side shelf on the top to put flyers about their movement and upcoming events. The blue of the box was inspired by the blue tape the librarians and their allies would wear over their mouths. </p>

				<p> Although librarians are usually thought of in terms of the building they work in, we wanted to show through the portable open library and interactive pins that librarians are the ones who truly make libraries the wonderful place that they are. </p>
