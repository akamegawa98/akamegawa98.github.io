		<div class="content"> This goal of this project was to make a piece of origami move with a servo motor. For my piece, I used a servo and a series of tracks to move a piece of cardstock that I had folded into a herringbone pattern.

		<div class="content"> Additionally, I wanted my origami to have a nice curvature to it as it move, so I constructed a tube out of corrugated cardboard that I could place under my piece in order to get it to bend.

In conclusion, I feel like this piece came out really elegantly. The focus remains on the stark whiteness of the origami and the black and cardboard elements that surround it give it a nice frame. In future iterations, Iâ€™d like to construct the base out of more robust material like acrylic. It would be interesting to use transparent acrylic so viewers could see the inner workings of the piece.
